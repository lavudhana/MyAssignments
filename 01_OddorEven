/*
1. Create a function named `checkOddOrEven` that takes a number as a parameter  

2. Use an `if` statement to check if the number is divisible by 2 
    Hint: if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0, then the num is even

3. Declare and initialize the variable  

4. Call the function and print the result
